// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

( 5 + 5 = 10)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

( if a + b = x
  if x is divisible by 2   Print "Even"
  if x is not divisible by  Print "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(	a} Estimated Temperture for the next five days in Cincinnati [degrees in Farenheit] = 81, 74, 81, 82, 81
 
	b} Average Estimated Temperture for next five days = [81 + 74 + 81 + 82 + 81 = 399 then 399 / 5 = 80]
	c} Print Lowest and Highest Estimated Tempertures for the next five days
	d} for minimum temperture print = "Min Est Temp for next 5 days = 74"
	   for maximum temperture print = "Max Est Temp for next 5 days = 82"						)
